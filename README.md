1. The MATLAB script MPSK.m demonstrates the full implementation of M-ary Phase Shift Keying (M-PSK) Modulation and Demodulation, with Bit Error Rate (BER) analysis for various M values, and respective Power Spectral Density (PSD).
2. The MATLAB script MQAM.m demonstrates M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation and Demodulation, including constellation diagram plotting, signal modulation, power spectral density (PSD) analysis, and Bit Error Rate (BER) vs. SNR evaluation across multiple QAM levels.
